# Dots Dots Dots

This is a 19K dots effect for the Commodore Amiga 500 (OCS) vintage computer,
written by
[Peregrine](https://demozoo.org/sceners/122747/)/Delicious Amigans
in July-August 2024.
Graphics and palette are the work of
[Yogib33r](https://demozoo.org/sceners/11949/)/Delicious Amigans, whereas
the music was composed by
[YV2149](https://demozoo.org/sceners/144233/) of
[The Other Days](http://theotherdays.net/) and played by
[LSPlayer](https://github.com/arnaud-carre/LSPlayer) by
[Leonard](https://demozoo.org/sceners/2527/)/Oxygene.

It is written in Motorola 68000 assembly, assembled and linked with
vasm and vlink by [Volker Barthelmann](http://www.compilers.de/vasm.html),
with the VSCode editor and its
[Amiga Assembly](https://github.com/prb28/vscode-amiga-assembly) extension
by prb28, compressed by
[Shrinkler](https://github.com/askeksa/Shrinkler) by
[Blueberry](https://demozoo.org/sceners/116/)/Loonies^Fnuque,
and tested on
[WinUAE](https://www.winuae.net/) by Toni Willen and others.

required; I especially thank C0ffeePanda, Caernun,
